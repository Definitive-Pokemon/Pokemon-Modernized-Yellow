# Pok√©mon Yellow Final [ON INDEFINITE HIATUS]

This is a hack/mod of Pokemon Yellow to make the game more fun and accesible. To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
Final saves are compatible with vanilla saves with a caveat: items from the bag may appear in the computer and vice versa.

# Features 
 - Increased speed of surfing
 - Intro music of Blue/Red reinstated
 - Decreased encounter rate while surfing
 - 'Run button': Press B to walk faster
 - Move effects changed and improved
   - Specifically made Struggle hit any Pokemon regardless of typing, removing the advantage Ghosts and Rocks had.
 - More balanced and diverse pokemon encounters
   - The in-game NPC trades allow the player to obtain Pokemon that were unobtainable in the vanilla game.
 - Team Rocket unique battle music
 - Swapped the sizes of the Computer and Bag item storage: Players can now pick up most items and not worry about running out of inventory.

# Status
The project is on a halt since interest has been lost.

## Planned Features
 - 'Context HM usage' partially copied from [ShinPokeRed](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered): would allow the player to simply press A on the overworld to get a prompt for HM usage like future games.
 - NPC scripting:
   - Firstly somehow making Yellow scripting understandable
   - Adding rematches and new battles to the game:
     - Possible Prof. Oak fight
     - Rematches against Gym Leaders
     - New Teams for the E4 and Champion when rematching
